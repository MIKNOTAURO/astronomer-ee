## Objective

This guide will detail the [astro-cli](https://github.com/astronomerio/astro-cli) and it's place in the Astronomer Platform.

## astro-cli

The astro-cli is the preferred programmatic way to interface with the Astronomer EE platform. On top of striving to maintain feature parity with the [orbit-ui](https://github.com/astronomerio/orbit-ui), the astro-cli is the fastest way to get started running Airflow locally. It is also one of the easiest ways to deploy your local projects to your Astronomer EE installation. 

To get started, follow the installation instructions in the project [README](https://github.com/astronomerio/astro-cli/blob/master/README.md). You can also see a full list of commands and their descriptions in the [docs directory](https://github.com/astronomerio/astro-cli/tree/master/docs).
