## Deploy via CI/CD

You can deploy DAGs with continuous integration / continuous deployment via the Astronomer CLI.

While this guide focuses on CircleCI, a similar setup can be accomplished using Travis CI, Jenkins, Codeship, TeamCity, GitLab CI/CD, or any other CI/CD system.

For background information and best practices on CI/CD, we recommend reading the article [*An Introduction to CI/CD Best Practices*](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/an-introduction-to-ci-cd-best-practices) from DigitalOcean.
