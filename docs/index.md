# Overview

Astronomer Enterprise Edition is an enterprise-grade data
engineering platform that allows any developer to jump to the task
of creating and managing data pipelines very quickly. The platform
includes a Heroku-like CLI capability to deploy pipelines, as
well as a New Relic-like interface to monitor and troubleshoot
running pipelines.

The platform leverages leading open source tools
including Kubernetes, Airflow, Prometheus, and Grafana â€” and also
includes a library of
[open-source Airflow connectors](https://github.com/airflow-plugins){:target="_blank"}
that we have been building and curating for the past year.
